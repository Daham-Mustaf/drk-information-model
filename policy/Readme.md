## Policy Implementation Options

The policies in this repository can be implemented in two ways:

### Option 1: Comprehensive Single File
All scenarios and their implementations are available in a single file for unified access:
- File: [cultural-data-exchange-policies.ttl](https://github.com/Daham-Mustaf/drk-information-model/blob/uc4-policy-update/policy/cultural-data-exchange-policies.ttl)
- Contains all five scenarios:
  - Scenario 1: Cultural API Access Management (Augsburg Theater API)
  - Scenario 2: Educational Archive Access
  - Scenario 3: Open Data Access
  - Scenario 4: Time-Limited Access
  - Scenario 5: Connector Reference Access

### Option 2: Separated Policy Templates and Examples
Alternatively, the same policies are available as separate templates and implementations:

### 1. Temporal and Spatial Access Policy
- Purpose: Controls access based on geographic location and time constraints
- File: `policies/tempo-spatial-access-policy.ttl`
- Use case: Region-restricted and time-limited access to cultural APIs

### 2. No Fee Research Policy
- Purpose: Manages free access for research and educational purposes
- File: `policies/no-fee-policy.ttl`
- Use case: Academic and research access to cultural archives

### 3. Open Access Policy
- Purpose: Defines perpetual open access with attribution requirements
- File: `policies/open-access-policy.ttl`
- Use case: Openly accessible cultural datasets

### 4. Time Window Policy
- Purpose: Enforces time-based access controls
- File: `policies/time-window-policy.ttl`
- Use case: Temporary access to cultural resources

### 5. Connector Reference Policy
- Purpose: Controls access based on connector ID validation
- File: `policies/connector-reference-policy.ttl`
- Use case: System-level access control for interconnected services

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Augsburg Theater Example
- Implements: Temporal and Spatial Access Policy
- Description: ShowTimes API access for regional stakeholders

### 2. Educational Archive Example
- Implements: No Fee Research Policy
- Description: University access to historical theater archives

### 3. Open Data Example
- Implements: Open Access Policy
- File: `examples/open-data-example.ttl`
- Description: Publicly accessible cultural dataset

### 4. Time-Limited Dataset Example
- Implements: Time Window Policy
- File: `examples/time-limited-dataset-example.ttl`
- Description: Dataset with fixed access period

### 5. Connector Protected Resource
- Implements: Connector Reference Policy
- File: `examples/connector-protected-resource.ttl`
- Description: System-level access control implementation

## Usage
1. Select appropriate policy template from `/policies`
2. Create implementation based on example patterns in `/examples`
3. Link implementation to template using `rdfs:isDefinedBy`
4. Customize constraints and parameters as needed

# Creative Commons Licenses, ODRL Translation, and Dataspaces

## üìú Creative Commons Licenses

Creative Commons (CC) licenses are a set of copyright licenses that allow creators to specify how others can use their work. To apply a CC license to your work, you need:

1. **Original work**: You must be the creator or copyright holder of the work you want to license.

2. **Understanding of license types**: You should know which CC license best suits your needs. There are several types:

   - CC BY (Attribution)
   - CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)
   - CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)
   - CC BY-ND (Attribution-NoDerivs)
   - CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)
   - CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)

3. **Decision on usage**: Each license type allows different uses of your work.

### üîç How to Apply a CC License

1. Choose the appropriate license on the Creative Commons website.
2. Get the license code or text.
3. Add this information to your work, whether it's online or offline.

## üîÑ Translating Creative Commons Licenses to ODRL

ODRL (Open Digital Rights Language) is more expressive than CC licenses. We can represent CC licenses in ODRL, but not always vice versa. Here's a general approach to translate CC licenses to ODRL:

1. **Identify the CC License**: Determine which CC license you're working with.

2. **Map CC terms to ODRL concepts**:
   - CC "Attribution" ‚Üí ODRL "attribute" action
   - CC "ShareAlike" ‚Üí ODRL "shareAlike" duty
   - CC "NonCommercial" ‚Üí ODRL "commercialize" action (prohibited)
   - CC "NoDerivatives" ‚Üí ODRL "derive" action (prohibited)

3. **Create ODRL Policy**: Structure an ODRL policy that represents the CC license terms.

4. **Example translations**:

   CC BY 4.0 in ODRL:
   ```json
   {
     "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
     "@type": "Set",
     "uid": "http://example.com/policy:cc-by-4.0",
     "permission": [{
       "action": "use",
       "duty": [{
         "action": "attribute"
       }]
     }]
   }
   ```

   CC BY-NC 4.0 in ODRL:
   ```json
   {
     "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
     "@type": "Set",
     "uid": "http://example.com/policy:cc-by-nc-4.0",
     "permission": [{
       "action": "use",
       "duty": [{
         "action": "attribute"
       }],
       "constraint": [{
         "leftOperand": "purpose",
         "operator": "neq",
         "rightOperand": "commercialize"
       }]
     }]
   }
   ```

5. **Validate**: Ensure the ODRL representation accurately captures the CC license terms.

## üåê ODRL in Dataspaces

ODRL serves as a crucial policy language within the context of Dataspaces. Dataspaces are an emerging approach to data management that aim to provide a unified view of data across multiple heterogeneous sources.

### Key Points:

1. **Policy Expression**: ODRL allows for the expression of fine-grained policies that govern data usage, access, and sharing within Dataspaces.

2. **Interoperability**: By using ODRL, Dataspaces can maintain consistent policy interpretation across different systems and organizations.

3. **Rights Management**: ODRL enables the clear articulation of rights and obligations associated with data assets in a Dataspace ecosystem.

4. **Open Source Requirement**: In many Dataspace implementations, there's a growing emphasis on open-source data publication. ODRL can be used to express these open-source requirements formally.


## üîì Open Source Data Publication

In the context of Dataspaces and modern data management practices, there's often a requirement for data to be published as open source. This aligns with principles of transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative innovation.

### Using ODRL for Open Source Data:

ODRL can be used to express open source requirements for data. Here's a simple example of how an ODRL policy might look for open source data:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
  "@type": "Set",
  "uid": "http://example.com/policy:open-source-data",
  "permission": [{
    "action": "use",
    "constraint": [{
      "leftOperand": "purpose",
      "operator": "isAnyOf",
      "rightOperand": ["research", "commercial", "non-commercial"]
    }],
    "duty": [{
      "action": "attribute"
    }, {
      "action": "shareAlike"
    }]
  }]
}
```

This policy allows the use of data for any purpose (research, commercial, or non-commercial) with the duties of attribution and sharing derivative works under the same terms.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- The examples provided are for illustrative purposes only.
- Always consult with legal experts when dealing with licensing issues.
- Keep up to date with the latest versions of both CC licenses and ODRL specifications.
- When implementing ODRL in Dataspaces, consider the specific requirements and constraints of your Dataspace ecosystem.
